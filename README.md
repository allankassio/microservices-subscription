# microservices-subscription

This system was implemented through independent microservices to enable subscriptions. This system allows for layers of reuse. Architecturally, the system is divided into a public layer, which can be consulted and accessed by other systems and graphical interfaces. And by a security-encapsulated layer, which accesses the databases and allows communication between services and the public layer.

## System Architecture Design
Put here a single chart with basic architeture


## Public Layer

### Public Service: [put here a description of public service]
- [Put here a sequence diagram]
- [other diagram??]

## Encapsuled Layer

### Subscription Service: [put here a description of service]
- [Put here a sequence diagram]
- [other diagram??]

### Email Service: [put here a description of service]
- [Put here a sequence diagram]
